- [Policy entrepreneurship: the neglected EA policy arm](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/MTg8EQqE2Ptvxzamm/policy-entrepreneurship-the-neglected-ea-policy-arm)
        <details>
        <summary>Summary</summary>
                This post advocates for investing in policy entrepreneurship, defined as individuals influencing policy outcomes through innovative strategies. It emphasizes the importance of shaping both inner (institutional) and outer (public opinion, media) policy landscapes, especially in Effective Altruism causes. Inspired by Will MacAskill's "Doing Good Better," the post highlights early intervention, plasticity, and the need for diverse policy entrepreneur roles. It identifies missed opportunities in political parties and stresses the impact of public opinion, the press, and grassroots support. Despite challenges, the post underscores the advocacy potential and balanced approach needed for impactful policy work.

- [Hiring: The Ignored Resource of Rejected EA Job Candidates](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ekLyLdiCCcD6BqbJR/hiring-the-ignored-resource-of-rejected-ea-job-candidates-1)   Community Building
        <details>
        <summary>Summary</summary>
        **Main point**: A large pool of talented applicants are applying to EA organizations. Only a small percentage of the pool is being hired. A more thoughtful use of "rejection email templates" could save job seekers & EA orgs hundreds of hours. It could also lead to more people working in EA-aligned jobs & fix some of the current hiring bottlenecks. The time investment of such a potentially impactful change is incredibly low -- i.e., it's just rewriting an email template.
        
        **Sub point**: For jobs with work tests that have been standing open for months, tailored feedback to near-miss candidates could help fill the positions & identify candidates who are excellent at receiving criticism.

- **[[Cause Exploration Prizes] Human Engram Preservation as a Neglected Cause Area](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/j8GYqBJavn5vwDFj6/cause-exploration-prizes-human-engram-preservation-as-a)** Transhumanism
        <details>
        <summary>Summary</summary>
        This post proposes the idea of preservation, which lies in challenging the conventional notion of "saving lives" by advocating for a method that aims to prolong human existence indefinitely. Preservation, through aldehyde fixation and vitrification, is presented as a means to maintain a person's memories and essence, effectively preventing their irreversible death. The author suggests that this could lead to profound societal changes, as people, feeling a sense of continuity in the future, might plan and think more coherently about their lives. Preservation is positioned as a way to address what the author sees as the ultimate injustice—unwilling death—and to enable individuals to have a chance at continuous improvement and flourishing beyond the limitations of current interventions.
        
        The idea is that, if technology advances sufficiently in the future, these preserved structures could be scanned or uploaded into a simulation, potentially restoring the person's consciousness.

- [Investigating ideologies](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/twaKWNjAc4KEz3kMq/investigating-ideology-want-to-earn-money-help-ea-and-or-me)  Others
        <details>
        <summary>Summary</summary>
        The post discusses the importance of investigating religious ideologies and encourages EA to seriously consider and explore religious ideologies, recognizing their potential impact on global issues and the effectiveness of altruistic efforts. 
        
        The author emphasizes that various religions claim to provide the best answers to the core EA question of "how to do the most good." and argues that investigating religious ideologies is imperative, as they may offer valuable insights and align with some of EA's current causes, suggesting that if even one religion is mostly correct, it could mean that EA is currently misguided.
        
        The post also acknowledges the challenges of objectively evaluating diverse ideologies, especially given the vast amount of evidence and the potential biases in religious discourse. The author suggests a need for a more comprehensive exploration of religious ideologies within the EA community, highlighting the potential benefits of such an investigation, even if all religious claims are ultimately found to be flawed.

- [Social Relationships: A Neglected Factor in Wellbeing](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/kF9aBCGrq3FwENaXM/social-relationships-a-neglected-factor-in-wellbeing) Healthcare
        <details>
        <summary>Summary</summary>
        The post argues that social relationships significantly impact wellbeing, often neglected in education and policy discussions. Various studies show correlations between strong social ties and positive outcomes, spanning youth and lifelong happiness, health, mitigating suffering, and reducing mortality. The quality of relationships matters more than quantity, and positive workplace relationships boost engagement. The World Health Organization's Quality of Life survey is suggested for measuring social relationships. The author explores implications for interventions, Effective Altruism (EA), and proposes considering social relationships as a controlled variable in studies. The post emphasizes the potential of relationship-centric interventions in supplementing existing approaches, addresses EA's growth through personal relationships, and calls for a clearer understanding of the impact on givers. It concludes that better relationships lead to better wellbeing outcomes, advocating for a broader perspective within EA and acknowledging the role of social connections in Doing Good Better.

- [About the Neglectedness of Longtermism and Future Work](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/zmn5jckrCKzgyPmEE/about-the-neglectedness-of-longtermism-and-future-work)    ???? Probably not a cause candidate
        <details>
        <summary>Summary</summary> 
        When discussing the importance of long-term problems, we usually consider very long timeframes, but when discussing the neglectedness of those problems, we usually consider only resources allocated in the near-term. This produces a skewed picture. A better way of comparing problems on different timeframes may be to estimate marginal cost-effectiveness directly. Alternatively, we can convert the units so that they are always the same, or perhaps model expected utility to take projected trends in importance, tractability and neglectedness (or any other variables we need) into account.

        <details>
        <summary>Summary</summary>
   This post points out the idea of convincing wealthy individuals, like celebrities, to donate to effective charities as a potential more impactful alternative to working a high-paying job and donating that income. It considers the potential ripple effect of influential figures endorsing donations and the efficiency of reaching out to many people in a short time. The post seeks counterpoints and envisions an ideal scenario where a movement encourages high-profile individuals to contribute to charity, influencing broader cultural expectations around philanthropy.
        
        Relevant answer: “there are already some people out there working on this. Some EA funding organizations as well as some big EA orgs do hire people to do “development” or engage with high-worth individuals that may become donors.[[3](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/WGMzKNkktx4Gpt9ui/should-building-effective-altruism-be-prioritized#fn016w4iimw43e)] As far as I know, the number of people working specifically on this is very low”

        <details>
        <summary>Summary</summary>The post discusses a forthcoming referendum in Switzerland to impose strict regulations on agricultural animal husbandry, applying the standards of the Swiss organic certificate "Bio Suisse." Despite initial dismissal, a recent poll predicts 55% approval. The author sees this as an opportunity for significant impact on animal rights at a relatively low cost. The proposed constitutional amendment would affect the entire country, potentially inspiring other nations, and could lead to a reduction in the number of animals slaughtered in Switzerland. The initiative committee plans a large campaign but lacks funding, making additional support crucial for the vote's outcome.

        The post author shares experience in community building over the past decade and proposes two models, the Community Action Model (CAM) and the Community Consumption Model (CCM), to structure healthy and thriving communities. It emphasizes four Community Actions (Create, Sustain, Rejuvenate, Innovate) and four Community Consumptions (Lurk, Engage, Learn, Participate) as essential elements for community success.
